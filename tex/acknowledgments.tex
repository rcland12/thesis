\acknowledgmenttext{I would like to acknowledge my advisor Dr. Stephen Carden. He spent a large amount of time with me in meetings teaching me and guiding me through this process. Not only was he a great advisor but also a great lecturer and friend, and I cannot speak highly enough regarding his knowledge and dedication to his job.

Along with Dr. Carden, I would like to acknowledge my other professors who sparked my interest in statistics. Both Dr. Arpita Chatterjee and Dr. Divine Wanduku are amazing professors and mentors. I could always count on both of them to put a smile on my face.

Lastly, I would also like to acknowledge my parents who helped me through my college education and beyond. They were by my side whenever I needed them and had concerns about my future. I love you and thank you for all that you do.}
