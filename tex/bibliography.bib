Schweizer on probabilistic metric spaces, and culminated in a correspondence with Fréchet that led to the identification and naming of copulas. The author speculates about possible future applications of the theory of distribution functions with given margins: In particular, there is the prospect of productive treatment of situations where, say, no common probability space can be found for a given set of random variables, but such common probability spaces exist for arbitrary proper subsets of the given set."

This proof yields the theorem in its fullest generality. A similar theorem that forms the basis for the inverse method of random number generation is also discussed and contrasted to the probability integral transform theorem. Typical applications are discussed. Despite their generality and far reaching consequences, these theorems are remarkable in their simplicity and ease of proof."
